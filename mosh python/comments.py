# comments in python to add notes for program
# example of bad comments : print sky is blue
# comment get outdated if code change to : ocean is blue, very bad practise
print("Sky is blue")


# calculates and returns the square of the number
def square (number):
    return number * number


# ^ bad practise also comment is for code below it, for this case is nothing thus getting PEP 8 notice
